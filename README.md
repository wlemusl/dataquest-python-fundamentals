# dataquest-python-fundamentals

The following is the final project of the Dataquest's Python Fundamentals course. The objective is to analyze the google playstore database with pure Python, avoiding the use of libraries such as Pandas or Numpy.

This final project aims to find out the characteristics of the most succesful mobile free apps, which are the ones with most users and best rankings. The information discovered here could be the input to the Developing Department to produce better apps, and hence, increase the net profits of the company. This projects includes: (1) data exploration, (2) data cleaning, and (3) data analysis, all with Python standard library.

This repository contains only one ipynb file and one csv file.

The unique csv file is:
